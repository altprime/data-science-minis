### Alert Boxes
Many a times we need our interactive python notebooks to be a little more interactive. In order to inform and warn the reader, we can use alert boxes withing the jupyter notebook itself. The alert box used are labelled: Information (blue box), Warning (yellow box), Success (green box), Danger (red box). Of course, these are just the traditional nomenclature which determine the colour of the box. Of course it can be used interchangably but may cause confusion for some readers. It's best to stick to the nomenclature. I've added these in the notebook here alogwith the raw code for you to reproduce and edit these as per your requirements.
