<h3>DATA SCIENCE MINIS</h3>

While workling on various projects over the course of time I have found that there are various small functions or sections of code that make life a bit easier. I have, since quite a while now, been collecting such code snippets. I hope these can be of as much use to everyone as they have to me. Every code snippet will have its own folder containing the python or R implementation and a readme explaining what problem it solves.

Cheers!
